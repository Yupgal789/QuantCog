    "This course will be taking place entirely online with \"synchronous\" classes on Zoom. As much as possible, I hope we can make this feel like we are all in this together, meeting in the same room. As such, these are the primary guidelines and expectations for our Zoom meetings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should keep your video on unless a transient issue arises (e.g., there is something seriously distracting going on in the room.) \n",
    "- You can, however, keep your microphone muted when not talking.\n",
    "- Feel free to ask questions anytime! It's often hard for me to see everyone, so interjecting by voice is perfectly fine (i.e., you don't need to use the hand-raising feature in the Zoom chat.)\n",
    "- We will be recording the lessons, which will be made available *only* to those in the class via UVACollab. \n",
    "\n",
    "*If you have any concerns about any of these policies, please set up a meeting with me and I will do my best to accommodate your needs.*\n"

    "Much of science, and especially psychology and neuroscience, involves testing and updating verbal theories, which are often imprecise and under-specified. \n",

    "Only by quantitative modeling of our experimental results can we hope to make significant progress in understanding the mechanisms that underlie cognition. \n",
